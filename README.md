## 04 - Komodo Company Outings
### This app allows the accountants at Komodo to do a better job of tracking their company outings. Typical accountants... Per the instructions, there is not a delete method as they won't be adding these outings until after they have occured. They aren't that forward thinking yet!

## 06 - Komodo's Green Plan
### This app is the base for Komodo's answer to global warming. They can use this app to add/remove/update vehicles, and have these changes be reflected in the company database. They can also use this app to pull a list of vehicles by their engine type. Doing so will also display the current average MPG for that engine type.
